# Git Setup

## Install on windows

Maybe it's complicated, but I don't use windows for several years. But with the big news for ubuntu in windows10, everything may become easy.

## Install on Mac OS X and Linux

I don't want to tell you, because it's so easy.

## Set up your personal info

```
$ git config --global user.name [username]
$ git config --global user.email [email]
```

The commands above will let the git know who you are. the  ``global``  option will set the attribute globally.

Remove the ``global`` will set the attribute inside your project.
