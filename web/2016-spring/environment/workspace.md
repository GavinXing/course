## Where is the problem

**tl;dr**

- name collision, ie: fork
- too many projects, ie: [gaocegege](https://github.com/gaocegege)

The long story (This is not real)

Jack needs to help Mary with here programming homework, so he just `CRTL+C` `CRTL+V`

````
D:/Code/
    -- homework
    -- homework-2
````

And Jack is popular among girls, so he need to help Rose, Bella, Jesca, Banana etc.

````
D:/Code/
    -- homework
    -- homework-2
    -- homework-3
    -- homework-4
    .....
````

And he got 10 homework and 4 labs for this course, boom! (No picture no BB)
